Developed by [Konscript](http://konscript.com), powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), based on [Kontemplate](http://github.com/konscript/kontemplate-wp).

## Kontemplate

For rapid theme development for WordPress, Kontemplate WP provides a rich boilerplate to help you get started building your own parent theme. It's works as a customizable skeleton theme that provides a rich set of default templates and a predefined structure for all theme files.

The source files can be found at [github.com/konscript/kontemplate-wp](http://github.com/konscript/kontemplate-wp)

## Toolchain

Out-of-the-box theme tools and configurations include:

* [Hybrid Core](http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core) (theme development toolset that provides many useful functions and shortcuts)

* [Compass](http://compass-style.org) (stylesheet framework to that links blueprint and css3 utils in sass)

* [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) (extension to css that adds nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance and more)

* [Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org) (css framework that, primarily, provides a solid grid-based layout)

* Dummy WP content (various dummy content that can be imported into WP)

* Git Ignore (.gitignore that disregard WP core files and alike for Git management)

## Plugins

There's a wide array of useful CMS-enabling plugins for WordPress.
